CrowdRE 2017: Second International Workshop on Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering 

https://crowdre.github.io/ws-2017/

Date: 4 September 2017
Place: Lisbon, Portugal

*** Motivation & Goal ***
The rise of mobile, social and cloud apps pose new challenges and opportunities to the field of requirements engineering (RE). Traditional techniques have difficulties scaling up to settings with thousands up to millions of users of a (software) product who form a large and heterogeneous group that can be denoted as a ‘crowd’. Researchers have identified several issues with applying RE in the new crowd paradigm. Initial methods and tools are being investigated, but we see the need for more tailored and holistic approaches focusing on Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering.
The Second Workshop on Crowd-Based Requirements Engineering (CrowdRE 2017) builds on the success of its first edition, which achieved the unification of visions into a coherent RE approach. It aims to attract papers with novel and innovative ideas on CrowdRE, and to facilitate interactive discussions between scientists and representatives of industry in order to define a roadmap for CrowdRE, assess the role of CrowdRE in the software development lifecycle, and work towards a shared base of CrowdRE resources.
